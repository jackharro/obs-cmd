This is the main manual. It introduces obs-cmd. We can have other manuals like this:

obs-cmd_topic.5
    • 5 is ‘file types and conventions’
    • 7 is ‘Miscellaneous (including […] conventions)’
    • I'm going to interpret 5 as ‘file type conventions’, so anything other than obs-cmd.1 should be in section 7.
